# Predicting Quality of Wine with Classification Techniques and Regression Modeling


This project aimed to predict whether a wine is good or bad based on its properties, which leads suppliers to be able do distinguish more easily the quality of a wine as well as the most important components. It was used data mining techniques and algorithms for all the preparation and analysis.
